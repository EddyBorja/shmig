These test work more often than not.

Periodically, and usually when I start a testing session,
they will crap out early on.  But if I re-run the script,
it then runs fine to completion.

I guess some race condition exposed by start/stopping 
docker containers so quickly, but who knows.

If it fails, just retry.
