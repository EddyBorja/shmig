Run a set of shmig commands against each backend (Sqlite3, MySQL
and PostgreSql) and verify that stdout and stderr is as expected.

Tests MySQL and PostgreSql by starting a Docker container, so to
test those clients you should  have Docker running.  The server
versions currently tested against are:

	postgres:9.6-alpine
	
	mysql:8

The script will only run the tests for the clients you have installed;
for example, if you don't have mysql installed it start a MySql
docker container.

When all tests pass, this is what it looks like:


$ make
./runsuite.sh sqlite3
		stdout: PASS
		stderr: PASS
./runsuite.sh psql
		waiting for container postgres:9.6-alpine to start .... started.
		stdout: PASS
		stderr: PASS
./runsuite.sh mysql
		waiting for container mysql:8 to start ................................... started.
		stdout: PASS
		stderr: PASS
